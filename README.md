# ValkyRiver: HyperConway
**HyperConway** is a viewer for cellular automata on the t{3, 7} tiling, also known as the truncated order-7 triangular tiling, the bitruncated heptagonal tiling, the hyperbolic soccerball, or the HyperRogue tiling. It was made using Python 3.10.

The tiling is made up of heptagons and hexagons. You can shift the tiling around by right-clicking one of the 7 heptagons that are diagonally away from the center. You can also rotate the tiling by clicking on the center heptagon.
